        "An analysis of how we discovered and exploited weaknesses in popular web application firewalls to bypass security controls.",
      content:
        "In this comprehensive case study, we examine multiple techniques for bypassing modern web application firewall (WAF) protections. We focus on three major commercial WAF solutions and their respective detection mechanisms. Through systematic testing and analysis, we were able to identify several bypass techniques that allowed malicious payloads to reach the protected applications.\n\nOur research involved creating a testing framework that automatically generated and mutated attack payloads, testing them against various WAF rule sets. This approach allowed us to discover several novel evasion techniques, including specific encodings and payload structures that successfully evaded detection.\n\nThe vulnerabilities were responsibly disclosed to the vendors, and all have since been patched. This write-up includes the technical details of the bypass methods as well as recommendations for WAF users on how to strengthen their configurations to prevent similar bypasses.",

        "This write-up documents our journey reverse engineering a proprietary protocol used in popular smart home devices. The investigation began when we identified unusual network traffic patterns from these devices, prompting a deeper analysis of the communication protocol.\n\nUsing a combination of static and dynamic analysis techniques, we were able to fully map the proprietary protocol structure and discovered it lacked fundamental security controls. The protocol transmitted sensitive data without encryption, used predictable session identifiers, and contained no protection against replay attacks.\n\nWe detail the methodology used to reverse engineer the protocol, including the tools and techniques that proved most effective. Our findings include proof-of-concept attacks that could allow an attacker to take control of affected devices, access sensitive information, or use the devices as an entry point into the home network.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure, the manufacturer has released firmware updates addressing these vulnerabilities. We provide recommendations for IoT developers to implement secure communication protocols from the design phase.",

        "This research paper analyzes common cloud security misconfigurations across AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud Platform that have resulted in significant data exposures over the past year. We examined over 50 publicly reported incidents to identify patterns and common failure points in cloud security configurations.\n\nOur analysis revealed that the most frequent misconfigurations included overly permissive IAM policies, publicly accessible storage buckets without proper access controls, and inadequate encryption settings for sensitive data at rest and in transit. Many organizations were found to be using default security settings that didn't align with security best practices for their specific use cases.\n\nWe present detailed case studies of three major incidents, analyzing the specific misconfigurations that led to the exposures and the remediation steps taken. The paper includes a comprehensive checklist for organizations to audit their cloud environments against these common misconfigurations, as well as automated scanning tools that can help identify potential vulnerabilities before they can be exploited.",

Our research focused on analyzing multiple major SAML libraries and service providers over a six-month period.\n\nWe discovered several critical implementation flaws including XML signature wrapping attacks, attribute statement manipulation, and session handling vulnerabilities. These flaws could allow an attacker to forge SAML assertions, modify authentication contexts, or hijack authenticated sessions.\n\nThe paper provides a detailed explanation of each vulnerability, including the underlying technical causes and exploitation methods. We include code examples showing both vulnerable implementations and the corresponding fixes. For each vulnerability, we provide a step-by-step walkthrough of the attack process with practical examples.\n\nFollowing responsible disclosure, vendors have released patches for the identified vulnerabilities.

We tested our detection system against a dataset of confirmed malicious packages as well as benign packages with unusual but legitimate behaviors.\n\nThe paper presents the architecture of our detection system, the features used for classification, and the performance metrics achieved in our testing. We also discuss the challenges of reducing false positives while maintaining high detection rates, particularly for sophisticated attacks that attempt to blend in with legitimate code patterns.\n\nWe conclude with practical recommendations for development teams to implement package vetting processes and continuous monitoring of dependencies to reduce the risk of supply chain compromises.",

We measured the entropy contributed by each fingerprinting vector and how this changes when users implement various privacy protections.\n\nThe paper examines the effectiveness of common countermeasures, including browser privacy modes, fingerprinting-resistant browsers, extensions, and VPNs. We provide quantitative data on how each approach impacts both fingerprinting resistance and normal browsing functionality.\n\nWe conclude with recommendations for both users seeking privacy and web developers looking to balance legitimate needs for fraud detection with respect for user privacy.

The paper then covers the process of analyzing the extracted firmware, including disassembly, binary analysis, and reverse engineering of proprietary protocols.\n\nOur analysis revealed several common security issues across multiple manufacturers, including insufficient authentication for firmware updates, unencrypted sensitive data, and vulnerable communication protocols between ECUs. The paper includes anonymized case studies of vulnerabilities discovered during our research, all of which were responsibly disclosed to the affected manufacturers.\n\nWe conclude with recommendations for automotive manufacturers and tier-1 suppliers to improve the security posture of vehicle ECUs, as well as suggestions for standardized security testing methodologies for the automotive industry.",
